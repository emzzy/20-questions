# Name Concatenation

Request the user's first name, last name and age.

Print out Welcome, <First-Name> <Last-Name> (<Age>) in a new line.

## Variants

1. Print out Welcome, <First-Name> <Last-Name> (<Year-Of-Birth>), where Year-of-Birth is derived as Age subtracted from Current-Year.

2. Request the user's gender.

Print out Welcome, <First-Name> [Son/Daughter] of <Last-Name> (<Year-Of-Birth>), where Son is printed out if male, and Daughter if female.

## Things to Consider (Extras)

When receiving age input, to be used in an arithmetic operation, you'll want to make sure it's a number.

When dealing with making decisions based off text, be mindful of cases. A user might enter Female as their gender, which is equivalent to female, and same as FEMALE.
